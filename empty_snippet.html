      A snippet is an HTML page with two sections: code and content.

      The 'code' section must contain the code that will execute once the
      snippet is loaded, and that will be modifiable by the editor user.

      The 'content' section must contain an HTML skeleton that will be
      injected in the editor and will be available for the snippet code to
      manipulate.
    -->

    <!-- 
      Code section. 
      Try adding some javascript here, like 'alert("hello");'.
      Then reload the editor and launch this snippet
    -->
    <pre id='code'></pre>

    <!-- Content section -->
    <div id='content_0'>
      <img style='margin-top: 150px; margin-left: 100px' src="html5logo.png">
    </div>
    <script>
      // Once you have prepared both sections, use this incantation to make the
      // snippet available in the editor:
      //
      // parent.editor.addShortCut(
      //   snippetName,
      //   elementContainingTheCode,
      //   elementContainingTheContent.cloneNode(true));
      //
      // Remember the cloneNode(), it's important!
      //
      // You also have to enumerate this html inside the loadSnippets() function in
      // editor.html 
      parent.editor.addShortCut(
        'empty',
        document.getElementById('code'),
        document.getElementById('content_0').cloneNode(true));
    </script>
